# K2 Command Pod (unofficial repository)
A 2-Kerbal Command Pod for [Kerbal Space Program][1] (by JFJohnny5).

## Overview
This mod adds a single part, the **K2 Command Pod**. This pod supports 2 Kerbals (*but only requires 1 - making it handy for rescue missions*). This allows you to send pilots and engineers/scientists on missions together, prior to unlocking the Mk 1-2 pod. 

The K2 pod unlocks with the *Advanced Flight Control* tech. It is balanced to encourage a good base of initial single-Kerbal missions before stepping up to two-Kerbal missions, where you can start training your engineers and scientists to prep for larger missions in the future.

## Features
* Support for 2 Kerbals (min. 1)
* Fully functional IVA
* Stock-alike style *inspired* by the Gemini capsule
* 1.25m size with a top 0.625m node
* Balanced to fit between the stock 1- and 3-Kerbal pods
* Module Manager configs (included) supports TAC Life Support and Connected Living Spaces
